## Summary: 
In light of the upcoming "silver tsunami" where corporation is facing significant change in the number of employees due to their forthcoming retirement, as around 90K of employees will be approaching retirement from the result of this analysis. 

Hence we estimate from this year to the year after the next, we will need to fill up around 90K of positions, either from internally or externally. 

The corporation will have around 2K of employees who are qualified to participate in the mentor program, and we suggest HR department to review the requirement for mentorship program to make necessary changes.
